                Yeah <br>
                I've been tryin' to call <br>
                I've been on my own for long enough <br>
                Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe <br>
                I'm going through withdrawals <br>
                You don't even have to do too much <br>
                You can turn me on with just a touch, baby <br>
                I look around and <br>
                Sin City's cold and empty (oh) <br>
                No one's around to judge me (oh) <br>
                I can't see clearly when you're gone <br>
                I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights  <br>
                No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch <br>
                I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night <br>
                Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust <br>
                Hey, hey, hey <br>
                I'm running out of time <br>
                'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky <br>
                    So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh <br>
                The city's cold and empty (oh) <br>
                No one's around to judge me (oh) <br>
                I can't see clearly when you're gone <br>
                I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights <br>
                No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch <br>
                I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night <br>
                Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust <br>
                I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know) <br>
                I could never say it on the phone (say it on the phone) <br>
                Will never let you go this time (ooh) <br>
                I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights <br>
                No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch <br>
                Hey, hey, hey <br>
                Hey, hey, hey <br>
                I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights <br>
                No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
