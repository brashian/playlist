                Don't lose your mind when you watch me walk away <br>
                Thunder and lightning, we're gonna detonate<br>
                Don't lose your mind when you watch me walk away<br>
                Thunder and lightning, and we never look back<br>
                <br>
                Solid gold, saw you walking like that<br>
                Step too close, turn to liquid like that<br>
                Sleek and bold, can we keep it like that?<br>
                And we never look back<br>
                <br>
                Fill it up, motor oil like that<br>
                Butter bomb and you light it like that<br>
                Throw it over your shoulder like that<br>
                And we never look back<br>
                <br>
                Shhh, don't wake the lion<br>
                Come meet the flame<br>
