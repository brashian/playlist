                Guess I never had a love like this (Ah-ha) <br>
                Hit me harder than I ever expected (Ooh) <br>
                We been up all goddamn night, all night, all night (Ah-ha) <br>
                Keep it going till we see the sunlight <br>
                <br>
                And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice<br>
                You know, you know, you know<br>
                Baby, I could see us in the real life<br>
                You know, you know you got<br>
                <br>
                Got me losin' all my cool <br>
                'Cause I'm burnin' up on you <br>
                In control of what I do <br>
                And I love the way you move <br>
                We'll get the heat and the thrill <br>
                Gives you more than any pill <br>
                Never runnin' out of juice <br>
                When it's only me and you <br>
                You got me, you got me losin' all my cool <br>
                I guess we're ready for the summer <br>
                <br>
              
                I like us better when we're intertwined (Ah-ha) <br>
                The way you touch me got me losin' my senses (Hey) <br>
                Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine (Ah-ha) <br>
                You got me working up an appetite-tite <br>
                <br>
                And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice <br>
                You know, you know, you know <br>
                Baby, I could see us in the real life <br>

                In control of what I do <br>
                And I love the way you move <br>
                We'll get the heat and the thrill <br>
