            <p>
                Ooh <br>
                Na-na, yeah <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I saw you dancing in a crowded room <br>
                You look so happy when I'm not with you <br>
                But then you saw me, caught you by surprise <br>
                A single teardrop falling from your eye <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't know why I run away <br>
                I'll make you cry when I run away <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                You could've asked me why I broke your heart <br>
                You could've told me that you fell apart <br>
                But you walked past me like I wasn't there <br>
                And just pretended like you didn't care <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't know why I run away <br>
                I'll make you cry when I run away <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Take me back 'cause I wanna stay <br>
                Save your tears for another <br> 
                Save your tears for another day <br>
                Save your tears for another day <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                So, I made you think that I would always stay <br>
                I said some things that I should never say <br>
                Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine <br>
                And now you won't love me for a second time <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't know why I run away, oh, girl <br>
                Said I'll make you cry when I run away <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay <br>
                Save your tears for another <br>
                I realize that I'm much too late <br>
                And you deserve someone better <br>
                Save your tears for another day (ooh, yeah) <br>
                Save your tears for another day (yeah) <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't know why I run away <br>
                I'll make you cry when I run away <br>
                Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl (ah) <br>
                I said save your tears for another day (ah) <br>
                Save your tears for another day (ah) <br>
                Save your tears for another day (ah)
